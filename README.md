# Identifying My Dad's Dog Using ResNet50:

This is a short project, where I am trying to identify which breeds make up my family's adopted dog "Elie". I will be using a pre-trained version of ResNet50 and comparing the results to the results of genetic testing of the dog

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `input` folder containing the pictures and the weights of the version of ResNet50 that was used.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `tensorflow` and `pillow` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
