    "# Identifying my Dad's Dog Using ResNet50\n",
    "\n",
    "The dog was adopted from Greece. The dog is a mix but it was not entirely clear which different breeds make up her genetic material. Later she was genetically tested to find this out. I don't know the result of the genetic test, but as an exercise in using pre-trained neural networks, I will try to find out if ResNet50 will be able to identify the breeds of the dog just by looking at pictures of her.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was done as an exercise while completing the [Deep Learning Turorials of Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning) and is very closely based on the example code in step 3. This was mainly done to go through the code myself and get a better understanding of it."
